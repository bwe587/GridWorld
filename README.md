# How to Use
![easy_grid_creation](https://github.com/bwe587/GridWorld/assets/105562270/a79231bd-bee1-46ac-a3ed-e474b95ffdff)

Creating a grid environment is as easy as pressing a button. Control the dimensions of your grid environment by interacting with the yellow buttons to adjust the number of rows and columns to your liking. Once you are satisfied, press the orange button to create your grid environment, and voila! You have created your first grid environment.

Now it is time to construct the walls of your grid environment. We don't want your agent to escape the environment, and who knows what he would do once he enters your house. To construct walls, simply click on the tiles to turn them into grey tiles.

Once that is done, assign penalty and reward tiles. Simply click on the tiles to change them to penalty or reward tiles. The penalty tiles are blue, while the reward tiles are green.

Control the row and column placement of your agent inside the grid environment by interacting with the purple buttons. Once you are satisfied, press the orange button located under the "Place Agent" panel. Your agent has now emerged into the realm of bits.

You may also adjust parameters: Gamma, Steps, and Explr. A breif overview is provided below:

*  Gamma: How much the past affects the future decision(s).

*  Steps: Number of discrete actions that an agent undergoes following the termination of the run. 

*  Explr: A curiosity parameter that mimics our desire for either exploring better rewards, or avoiding worst ones.
